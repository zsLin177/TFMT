# TFMT
A Transformer For Machine Translation

- Use the transformer to translate natural language to SQL
- The dataset is the Spider
- Use the command 'python3 train.py' to train the model, and 'python3 evaluation.py' to translate the dev set. And the translate results can be evaluated via spider's evaluate process. Spider's evaluate process is at https://github.com/taoyds/spider.
- NL2SQL is quite a difficult problem, so, please do not expect this model has a good result.
